# lambda_gpio_control.py
# On-Demand Greengrass lambda to trigger GPIO Pins 8 - 15 on a Raspberry Pi.
# Is assumed these pins corrolate to relays 1 - 8 on the GPOIO relay board.
# see pin_map below for moe detail.
# 
# Greengrass Contaier Parameters:
# Note: Must run as root to access sysbus succesfully, see below link for required config settings
# https://docs.aws.amazon.com/greengrass/latest/developerguide/lambda-group-config.html#lambda-running-as-root
# TODO: Will be able to sue AWS Greengrass RasPi GPIO connector instead of running as root ID
# Another user ID/group ID: 0
# Containerization: No Container (Always)
# Lambda lifecycle: On-demand function
# All else to default
#
# Will initilise the GPIOs and set all relays to closed when first depolyed, beware of this 
# if you have anything of importants running on the relays. Once deployed, you need to trigger 
# the lambda with settings as describes below to set the relays open of closed.
