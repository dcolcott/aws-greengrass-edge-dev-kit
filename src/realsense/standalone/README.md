#### Intel RealSense Code Examples

Code examples in this directory can run as standalone Python3 scripts.

To execute:
* **Simpe Example:** ```python3 realsense-simple.py```
* **Advanced Example:** ```python3 realsense-advanced.py```

**Example:** The expected output is as below:
```
python3 realsense-advanced.py

## Saved RBG and Color Images
The RPG and colorised depth (and processed depth if using advanced) images will be saved to: /home/pi/Desktop/
Or where ever you have set the DEPTH_IMAGE_PATH, DEPTH_COLORMAP_PATH, PROCESSED_DEPTH_COLORMAP_PATH, etc in the code examples. 

You can copy them to your local machine via SCP (assumuming you have SSH acess to the Raspberry Pi or edge device).
